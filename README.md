# Tweet Designs to Code

Transform tweet designs into components with ease.

## What is Tweet Designs to Code?

A collaborative platform that:
- Transforms innovative tweet designs into ready-to-use code components
- Provides a registry of high-quality, community-curated UI elements
- Enables developers to quickly implement beautiful designs

- **Primary Technologies Used:**
  - TypeScript
  - React
  - Framer Motion
  - shadcn/ui

##  Quick Start

### Installation
We follow the same seamless installation process as shadcn/ui. Install components directly from our registry:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://tweet-to-code.vercel.app/r/ui/component-name.json"
```

### Example: Installing Sherlock Hero Component
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://tweet-to-code.vercel.app/r/ui/sherlock-hero.json"
```

The component will be automatically added to `components/ui/sherlock-hero.tsx`.
